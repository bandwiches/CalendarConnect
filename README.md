# ![CalendarConnect Icon](https://github.com/ethanrasmussen/CalendarConnect/blob/master/art/cc_icon.png =200x) CalendarConnect
This program links your Discord status to your calendar!

### Main Limitations (With the current Teamup version):
- Cannot use "All-Day" events within Teamup
- Cannot detect different Teamup sub-calendars
- Local time (on PC) must match timezone of Teamup calendar
- Cannot handle concurrent events

### TODO List (Not in any particular order):
- Error/exception handling, for when a user mis-enters their information, or Discord and/or Teamup are offline
- Support for Google Calendar & Outlook Calendar
- Support for changing Discord status between 'online', 'idle', 'do not disturb' and 'invisible' based on calendar events
- Support for "all-day" events
- Support for concurrent events (either by displaying both, or by having one override another)
